# Math Expression Calculator

The Math Expression Calculator is, at its core, a [Mathematical Expression Parser](https://www.google.com/search?q=mathematical+expression+parser).

The parser can evaluate expressions containing Square Root, Power, Multiplication, Division, Subtraction, and Addition.

The parser has full support for parentheses, including nesting.

The parser recognizes [Implicit Multiplications](https://www.google.com/search?q=implicit+multiplication) and follows the [Order of Operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations).

## FEATURES:
You can input complex math expressions.

Users can retrieve previously used math expressions by clicking on them.

Users can store and retrieve results using memory controls.

Users can easily calculate their Body Mass Index.

Upcoming features:

- App Language Selection (English, Portuguese, Spanish).
- App Customization (Switch Dark/Light Mode, select accent color).
- 1st and 2nd-degree Equation Parser.
- Interest Converter (daily -> monthly -> annual, and vice-versa).
- Unit Converter (Mass, Length, Speed, etc).

The primary objective of this project is to provide a foundation for a career as a Flutter Developer.

The project serves the following purposes:

- Implement coding techniques, ideas, and concepts acquired during the course of learning.
- Monitor my progress in the development of the application.
- Track improvements in Flutter, Dart, and general coding skills.

### Phases of development (TODO list):

**PHASE 1:**
  - Introduce a WrapAround mode to enlarge digits on display when necessary. COMPLETED!
  - Implement a feature to show the entire equation in history. COMPLETED!
  - Develop a Scientific Notation function for displaying large numbers.

**PHASE 2:**
  - Incorporate interactive functionality to the display text:
    - Implement a cursor.
    - Refactor the expression in real-time.
    - Allow users to recall previous calculations from history. COMPLETED!

**PHASE 3:**
  - Create a new page.
  - Add a percentage and interest converter (annual -> monthly -> daily).
  - Add a unit converter, such as length, weight, and temperature.

**PHASE 4:**
  - Create a new page.
  - Enable users to customize the app:
    - Build two sliders:
      - Slider 1: primary color.
      - Slider 2: brightness level.
